"""This module implements profile indexing.

Rekall relies on accurate profiles for reliable analysis of memory artifacts. We
depend on selecting the correct profile from the profile repository, but
sometimes its hard to determine the exact profile to use. For windows, the
profile must match exactly the GUID in the driver.

However, sometimes, the GUID is unavailable or it could be manipulated. In that
case we would like to determine the profile version by applying the index.

The profile repository has an index for each kernel module stored. We can use
this index to determine the exact version of the profile very quickly - even if
the RSDS GUID is not available or incorrect.
