This module implements the xpress decompression algorithm in c. This algorithm
is used in hibernation files among other things. Rekall is shipped with a
python only decompression algorithm, but this is very slow. By decompressing in
C we can increase performance of hibernation file parsing.

To install, simply run:

python setup.py install

This will build the module and install on the system. Rekall will
automatically choose the fast decompressor if it is available.
