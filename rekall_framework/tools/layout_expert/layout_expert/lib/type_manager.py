    C code is not context free - this means we need to understand C code in
    order to parse it properly. In particular the parser needs to be aware of
    types. Consider the following expression:

    (x) & y

    If x is a type this represents a cast of a pointer reference to the variable
    y. But if x is a variable then this is an AND operation between two
    variables. Therefore, the parser needs to have type manager which learns
    about new types during the parsing (when the parser meets typedef
    statements) and can resolve these situations where type information is
    required.
