""" This module implements a class registry.

We scan the memory_plugins directory for all python files and add those classes
which should be registered into their own lookup tables. These are then ordered
as required. The rest of Rekall Memory Forensics will then call onto the
registered classes when needed.

The MetaclassRegistry automatically adds any derived class to the base
class. This means that we do not need to go through a special initializating
step, as soon as a module is imported, the plugin is registered.
